# AI_Text_Summarizer
This code creates a Flask web application that cleans text from various sources (direct input, PDF files, or URLs) and generates multiple types of summaries—extractive, abstractive, and simplified versions—using NLP models like BART and T5, while also evaluating summary quality through readability metrics and compression ratios.
